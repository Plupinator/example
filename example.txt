Product Overview -- FUTURE CONTRACTS!!!
 -- later FC changes
The new Contract Savings module (aka Project x aka Supply Analytics tool) presents members and those acting on behalf of our members, contract savings opportunities. It leverages hospital submitted spend data and supplier reported PRS data to show opportunities from low effort to high effort, categories where a member could save money without changing anything, just by activating a contract or more complex opportunities that involve changing their buying pattern, to convert supplier spend to contracts with higher savings.  

 

The key component of the tool is the Contract Optimizer that shows members their opportunities on all available Vizient contracts. This is very different from our previous Supply Analytics tools that only presented one contract for the member to use. 

 

Please reference the Quick Reference User Guide located in MS Teams here
